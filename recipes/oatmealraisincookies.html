            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Oatmeal raisin cookies are a nice sweet treat to cap off a night. This recipe makes four dozen soft and chewy oatmeal raisin cookies. The use of rolled oats is ideal, but old-fashioned oats may also be used. It is advised to avoid using steel cut oats or instant oats. Store the prepared cookies at room temperature and they should be good-as-new for up to a week. </p>
